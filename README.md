This is a basic weather app  made using weather api link-https://www.weatherapi.com/
The icons were taken from - https://www.flaticon.com/
This need one major change that is the weather icon changes when the weather is changed 
Lastly you can make it more visually appealing by adding changing the background when the weather changes/ wind speed/ humidity changes 
I made it just to polish my js skills and practice on the apis 
Technoligies used- HTML, CSS, JS - axios library

Thank you
